If something comes in quotes, it is not defined in R. 


```{r}

ages <- c(25, my_age, 32)

names <- c("Menglin", "Mine", "Rafael")

data.frame(age = ages, name = names)
```

## Vocabulary

```{r eval=FALSE}
do(something)
```

`do()` is a function;   
`something` is the argument of the function.
--

```{r eval=FALSE}
do(something, colorful)
```

`do()` is a function;   
`something` is the first argument of the function;   
`colorful` is the second argument of the function.

## Getting Help

In order to get any help we can use `?` followed by function (or object) name. 

```{r eval=FALSE}
?c
```

After function names do not leave any spaces.

Before and after operators (e.g. <-, =) leave spaces. 

Put a space after a comma, **not** before. 

Object names are all lower case, with words separated by an underscore.

What if we tracked our file with a better names for each version and have only 1 file **hw1**?

--

hw1 **added questions 1 through 5**

--

hw1 **changed question 1 image**

--

hw1 **fixed typos**

We will call the descriptions in bold **commit** messages.

## git vs. GitHub

- git allows us to keep track of different versions of a file(s).

- GitHub is a website where we can store (and share) different versions of the files.

## Cloning a repo

**repo** is a short form of repository. Repositories contain all of your project's files as well as each file's revision history.

For this bootcamp our daily repos (lecture code, activity etc.) are hosted on Github. 

To **clone** a GitHub repo to our computer, we first copy the cloning link as shown in screencast then start an RStudio project using that link.  

**Cloning** a repo pulls (downloads) all the elements of a repo available at that specific time. 

---

class: middle

## Commits

Once you make changes to your repo (e.g. take notes during lecture, answer an activity question). you can take a snapshot of your changes with a commit.

This way if you ever have to go back in version history you have your older commits to get back to. 

This is especially useful, for instance, if you want to go back to an earlier solution you have committed.

---

class: middle

## Push

All the commits you make will initially be local (i.e. on your own computer). 

In order for me to see your commits and your final submission on any file, you have to **push** your commits. In other words upload your files at the stage in that specific time.

## (An incomplete) Git/GitHub glossary

**Git:** is software for tracking changes in any set of files

**GitHub:** is an internet host for Git projects.

**repo:** is a short form of repository. Repositories contain all of your project's files as well as each file's revision history.

**clone:** Cloning a repo **pulls** (downloads) all the elements of a repo available at that specific time. 

**commit:** A snapshot of your repo at a specific point in time. We distinguish each commit with a **commit message**. 

**push:** Uploads the latest "committed" state of your repo to GitHub.
